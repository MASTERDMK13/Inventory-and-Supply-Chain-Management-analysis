Delivered end-to-end supply chain visibility by visualizing Lead Time and Backorder data, enabling the operations team to pinpoint regional bottlenecks and improve fulfillment efficiency.
Headline: Optimizing Fulfillment: A Supply Chain Visibility Dashboard

The Story (The "Why"): In supply chain management, unseen bottlenecks are the silent killers of profitability. I wanted to solve the problem of "operational blindness"—where managers know orders are late but don't know where they are getting stuck.

The Solution: I built an end-to-end Power BI dashboard that connects Lead Time data with Backorder logs. This wasn't just about showing numbers; it was about mapping the journey of a product from warehouse to customer to see where the chain was breaking.

Key Insights:Regional Bottlenecks: The data revealed specific regions where "Lead Time" consistently spiked, correlating directly with high backorder rates.
Efficiency Gains: By visualizing these gaps, the dashboard enables operations teams to proactively re-route inventory, significantly improving fulfillment efficiency
